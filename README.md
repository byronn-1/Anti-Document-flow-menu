# Anti-Document-flow-menu

Hi, So after a recent interview I decided that I needed to brush up on my basic logical programatic thinking. I decided to try and make a website based off another website some one else had written. Mainly to pick up my spirits I chose a very basic looking website (it had been written with PHP and wordpress by the looks of things. It however turned out that the website I was copying was a much more complex problem than I had initally considered. It involved the integrated use of differing techniques from four technologies HTML, vanilla javascript, jQuery and CSS. More specifically the new challenges I faced were from using a combination of

learning from fresh requestAnimationFrame() because CSS animations seemingly didn't want to be engouraged to render with setTimeout(),
Iterating HTML NodeLists with vanilla Js,
CSS Aninmations,
CSS Transitions (which I had to drop for CSS Animations because I couldn't get them to render?),
adding and removing classes with jQuery,
and the use of jQuery to battle problems of document.getElementsByClassList().

Oh and also using jQuery to reverse a HTML NodeList (which turns out to be a very handy trick)
